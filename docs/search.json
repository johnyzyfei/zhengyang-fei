For the limit of a vector function,\n\\[\\lim_{t \\to a} \\bar{r}(t) = \\left\\langle \\lim_{t \\to a} f(t), \\lim_{t \\to a} g(t), \\lim_{t \\to a} h(t) \\right\\rangle\n\\quad  \\newline \\text{assuming the limits of all the component functions exist.}\\]\nFurthermore, we say a vector function \\(\\bar{r}(t)\\) is continuous at \\(a\\) if \\(\\lim{t \\to a} = \\bar{r}(a)\\).\nNext, let’s talk about the derivatives of vector functions. \\[\\frac{d\\bar{r}}{dt} = \\bar{r}'(t) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{\\bar{r}(t+h) - \\bar{r}(t)}{h}\\]\nNote that the derivative of a vector function is just the vector of the derivatives of its components. That is, \\[\\bar{r}'(t) = \\langle f'(t), g'(t), h'(t) \\rangle = f'(t)\\bar{i} + g'(t)\\bar{j} + h'(t)\\bar{k}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nTheorem: Differential Rules of Vector Functions.\nSuppose that \\(\\vec{u}(t)\\) and \\(\\vec{v}(t)\\) are differentiable vector functions, \\(c\\) is a scalar, and \\(f\\) is a real-valued function. Then, \\[\\begin{align}\n&1.\\quad \\frac{d}{dt}[\\vec{u}(t) + \\vec{v}(t)] = \\vec{u}'(t) + \\vec{v}'(t) \\\\\n&2.\\quad \\frac{d}{dt}[c \\vec{u}(t)] = c \\vec{u}'(t) \\\\\n&3.\\quad \\frac{d}{dt}[f(t)\\vec{u}(t)] = f'(t)\\vec{u}(t) + f(t)\\vec{u}'(t) \\\\\n&4.\\quad \\frac{d}{dt}[\\vec{u}(t) \\cdot \\vec{v}(t)] = \\vec{u}'(t) \\cdot \\vec{v}(t) + \\vec{u}(t) \\cdot \\vec{v}'(t) \\\\\n&5.\\quad \\frac{d}{dt}[\\vec{u}(t) \\times \\vec{v}(t)] = \\vec{u}'(t) \\times \\vec{v}(t) + \\vec{u}(t) \\times \\vec{v}'(t) \\\\\n&6.\\quad \\frac{d}{dt}[\\vec{u}(f(t))] = f'(t)\\vec{u}'(f(t)) \\\\\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nGiven how neatly the limit and derivative rules extend to vector-valued functions, it’s no surprise that similar rules apply to definite (and indefinite) integrals as well. \\[\\begin{align}\n\\int_a^b \\vec{r}(t) , dt\n&= \\left( \\int_a^b f(t) , dt \\right)\\vec{i} + \\left( \\int_a^b g(t) , dt \\right)\\vec{j} + \\left( \\int_a^b h(t) , dt \\right)\\vec{k} \\\\\n&= \\left( F(t) \\big|_a^b \\right)\\vec{i} + \\left( G(t) \\big|_a^b \\right)\\vec{j} + \\left( H(t) \\big|_a^b \\right)\\vec{k} \\\\\n&= \\left( F(b) - F(a) \\right)\\vec{i} + \\left( G(b) - G(a) \\right)\\vec{j} + \\left( H(b) - H(a) \\right)\\vec{k}\n\\end{align}\\]\nFinally, the arc length formula extends naturally to vector-valued functions and is given by: \\[\\begin{align}\nL &= \\int_a^b \\sqrt{[f'(t)]^2 + [g'(t)]^2 + [h'(t)]^2} \\, dt \\\\\n  &= \\int_a^b \\sqrt{\\left( \\frac{dx}{dt} \\right)^2 + \\left( \\frac{dy}{dt} \\right)^2 + \\left( \\frac{dz}{dt} \\right)^2} \\, dt \\\\\n  &= \\int_a^b \\left| \\vec{r}\\,'(t) \\right| \\, dt\n\\end{align}\\]"
