    "text": "Vector Functions\nA vector function is a function that takes one (or more) variables and returns a vector of functions. We will only discuss the case where the function takes one variable.\nIn \\(\\mathbb{R}^3\\), a single variable vector function have the form\n\\[\\bar{r}(t) = \\langle f(t), g(t), h(t) \\rangle = f(t)\\bar{i} + g(t)\\bar{j} + h(t)\\bar{k}\\] Let’s now talk about limits, derivatives and integrals with vector functions. For the limit of a vector function,\n\\[\\lim_{t \\to a} \\bar{r}(t) = \\left\\langle \\lim_{t \\to a} f(t), \\lim_{t \\to a} g(t), \\lim_{t \\to a} h(t) \\right\\rangle\n\\quad  \\newline \\text{assuming the limits of all the component functions exist.}\\]\nFurthermore, we say a vector function \\(\\bar{r}(t)\\) is continuous at \\(a\\) if \\(\\lim{t \\to a} = \\bar{r}(a)\\).\nNext, let’s talk about the derivatives of vector functions. \\[\\frac{d\\bar{r}}{dt} = \\bar{r}'(t) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{\\bar{r}(t+h) - \\bar{r}(t)}{h}\\]\nNote that the derivative of a vector function is just the vector of the derivatives of its components. That is, \\[\\bar{r}'(t) = \\langle f'(t), g'(t), h'(t) \\rangle = f'(t)\\bar{i} + g'(t)\\bar{j} + h'(t)\\bar{k}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nTheorem: Differential Rules of Vector Functions.\nSuppose that \\(\\vec{u}(t)\\) and \\(\\vec{v}(t)\\) are differentiable vector functions, \\(c\\) is a scalar, and \\(f\\) is a real-valued function.

Note its similarity to the definitions of the single variable case.\nThere are many alternate notations for partial derivatives. Below are some most common ones used\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_x(x, y) = f_x &= \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left( f(x, y) \\right) = z_x = \\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial x} = D_x f \\\\\nf_y(x, y) = f_y &= \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} \\left( f(x, y) \\right) = z_y = \\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial y} = D_y f\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nTo compute the derivative with respect to one variable \\(x\\), we regard the other variable \\(y\\) as constant and differentiate \\(f(x,y)\\) with respect to \\(x\\); the same applies when differentiating with respect to \\(y\\).\nWhen computing derivatives of second order, we use the following notation which can be extended to three or more variables. These are sometimes called mixed partial derivatives since we are taking derivatives with respect to more than one variable. \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n(f_x)_x = f_{xx} = f_{11} &= \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left( \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} \\right)\n= \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} = \\frac{\\partial^2 z}{\\partial x^2} \\\\\n(f_y)_x = f_{yx} = f_{21} &= \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left( \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} \\right)\n= \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x \\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial^2 z}{\\partial x \\partial y} \\\\\n(f_x)_y = f_{xy} = f_{12} &= \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} \\left( \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} \\right)\n= \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y \\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial^2 z}{\\partial y \\partial x} \\\\\n(f_y)_y = f_{yy} = f_{22} &= \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} \\left( \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} \\right)\n= \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y^2} = \\frac{\\partial^2 z}{\\partial y^2}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nNote that the notation might be confusing at first glance, since sometimes it is read from left to right and others right to left.\nIn general, it is not true that \\(f_{xy} = f_{yx}\\). However the below theorem states when this is satisfied.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nTheorem: Clairaut’s Theorem.\nSuppose that \\(f\\) is defined on a disk \\(D\\) that contains the point \\((a, b)\\). If the functions \\(f_{x,y}\\) and \\(f_{y, x}\\) are both continuous on \\(D\\), then \\[f_{xy}(a,b) = f_{yx}(a,b)\\]\n\n\nLastly, if we suppose that \\(f\\) has continuous partial derivatives, then an equation of the tangent plane to the surface \\(z = f(x, y)\\) at the point \\(P(x_0, y_0, z_0)\\) is \\[z - z_0 = f_x(x_0, y_0)(x - x_0) + f_y(x_0, y_0)(y - y_0)\\]"

Sketch the PDF again and mark this probability on your plot.\nYou find out that your exam is entirely multiple choice, and if you study for less than \\(4\\) hours, there is a \\(30\\%\\) probability that you will pass your exam by randomly guessing the answers.
