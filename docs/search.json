I also have the privilege to work as a Student Researcher at the Institute for Better Health, Trillium Health Partners, under the supervision of Dr. Simona Minotti.\n\n\nMy research spans areas including patient experience and hospital quality improvement, where I analyze large-scale survey data to identify factors influencing care outcomes, as well as biomarker analysis for juvenile arthritis, where I support statistical modeling and clinical interpretation in collaboration with healthcare researchers.\n\n\nI earned my HBSc in Statistics and Mathematics from Toronto in 2024, where my passion for health science, data science, and education blossomed while working with Dr. Asal Aslemand and others.\n\n\nBeyond academics, music has always been a source of joy for me.
