# Week 1

### Question 1

b)  Suppose $\Omega = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}$ and let $A = \{1, 2, 4, 5\}$, $B = \{1, 3, 5\}$ and $C = \{2, 4, 6\}$. Use this example to verify the two results in the distributive law.
:::

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
### Solution

We need to verify two things. \newline i. $A \cap (B \cup C) = (A \cap B) \cup (A \cap C)$

\begin{align*}
B \cup C &=  \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\} \\
A \cap (B \cup C) &=  \{1, 2, 4, 5\} \\
A \cap B &=  \{1, 5\} \\
A \cap C &=  \{2, 4\} \\
(A \cap B) \cup (A \cap C) &=  \{1, 2, 4, 5\}
\end{align*}

Therefore, $A \cap (B \cup C) = (A \cap B) \cup (A \cap C)$ as required.

\bigskip

ii. $A \cup (B \cap C) = (A \cup B) \cap (A \cup C)$

\begin{align*}
B \cap C &= \{1, 3, 5\} \cap \{2, 4, 6\} = \emptyset \\
A \cup (B \cap C) &=  \{1, 2, 4, 5\} \\
A \cup B &=  \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\} \\
A \cup C &=  \{1, 2, 4, 5, 6\} \\
(A \cup B) \cap (A \cup C) &= \{1, 2, 4, 5\}
\end{align*}

Therefore, $A \cup (B \cap C) = (A \cup B) \cap (A \cup C)$ as required.

### Question 2

In R, write R code to simulate rolling a fair six-sided die once, 10 times, 100 times, and 1000 times.

a)  Estimate the probability of rolling a 3 or higher based on 1000 simulated dice rolls.
b)  If you were to repeat your simulation, would you end up with the same estimate? Why or why not.
:::

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
### Solution

We first simulate the rolling of a fair six-sided die 10, 100, and 1000 times.

```{r}
set.seed(2025) # set seed for reproducibility
sample(1:6, 10, replace=TRUE)  # Rolling a fair six-sided die 10 times
sample(1:6, 100, replace=TRUE) # 100 times
sample(1:6, 1000, replace=TRUE) # 1000 times
```

The probability of rolling a 3 or higher based on 1000 simulated dice rolls is

```{r}
set.seed(2025) # set seed for reproducibility
mean(sample(1:6,1000,replace=TRUE)) 
```

If we were to repeat this simulation (without setting seed) five times, we get

```{r}
mean(sample(1:6,1000,replace=TRUE)) 
mean(sample(1:6,1000,replace=TRUE)) 
mean(sample(1:6,1000,replace=TRUE)) 
mean(sample(1:6,1000,replace=TRUE)) 
mean(sample(1:6,1000,replace=TRUE)) 
```

So no, every time this is repeated, we will get different sequences of simulated rolls, and will therefore have different estimates for the probability of rolling 3+.

Hence, it is important to set a seed for reproducibility purposes so other people can confirm our results.

### Question 3

Consider the word ‘STATISTICS’. Is the number of unique arrangements of the letters in ‘STATISTICS’ 10!? Justify your answer and compute the probability that a random rearrangement of the letters in ‘STATISTICS’ will spell the word ‘STATISTICS’.
:::

:::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
### Solution

No, because some letters are repeated. The word "STATISTICS" has 10 letters in total, but with repeated letters: S 3 times, T 3 times, I 2 times, and A, C appear once each.

To count the number of distinct permutations, we divide 10! by the factorials of the repeated letters: $\dfrac{10!}{3! \times 3! \times 2!} = \dfrac{3628800}{72} = 50400$.

::: callout-note
**Theorem: Permutations of a multiset**.

*Let S be a set with n (not necessarily distinct objects), such that there are* $n_1$ objects of type 1, $n_2$ objects of type 2, $\cdots$, $n_k$ objects of type k, where $n_1 + n_2 + ... + n_k = n$. Then the number of arrangements of these objects is $\dfrac{n!}{n_1! \times n_2! \times \cdots \times n_k!}$
:::

Since there is only one unique arrangement of the word "STATISTICS", the probability is $\boxed{\dfrac{1}{50400}}$

```{r}
numerator <- 1
denominator <- factorial(10) / (factorial(3)*factorial(3)*factorial(2))

(prob <- numerator/denominator)
```

### Question 4

Assume birthdays are equally likely to occur in each of the 12 months of the year. What is the probability that at least two people in a group of three students have birth months in common? Be sure to show your steps.
:::

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
### Solution

It is easier to work with complements when you see the phrase "at least". So that we get $$\begin{align*}
P(\text{at least one shared}) 
&= 1 - P(\text{all different}) \\
&= 1 - \frac{12 \times 11 \times 10}{12^3} \\
&= 1 - \frac{11 \times 10}{12^2} \\
&= 1 - \frac{110}{144} \\
&= 1 - 0.7639 \\
&= \boxed{0.2361}
\end{align*}$$

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alternatively, let \begin{align*}
A &= \text{first student is assigned any birth month (no restriction)} \\
B &= \text{second student has a different birth month from the first} \\
C &= \text{third student has a different birth month from both the first and second}
\end{align*}

Then, \begin{align*}
P(A \cap B \cap C) 
&= P(A) \cdot P(B \mid A) \cdot P(C \mid A \cap B) \\
&= 1 \cdot \frac{11}{12} \cdot \frac{10}{12} \\
&= \frac{110}{144} \\
&\approx 0.7639
\end{align*}

So the probability that at least two students share a birth month is: \begin{align*}
P(\text{at least one shared}) 
&= 1 - P(\text{all different}) \\
&= 1 - 0.7639 \\
&= \boxed{0.2361}
\end{align*}
