## Parametric Equations

Week 2 tutorial notes [TBP](){download="week2"}

Suppose there is a third variable $t$ (called a parameter), we can *parameterize* $x$ and $y$ by the equations \begin{align*}
x &= f(t) \\
y &= y(t)
\end{align*} where $a \le t \le b$ which has initial point $(f(a), g(a))$ and terminal point $(f(b), g(b))$.


Now, we would like to find derivatives and compute arclengths of the parametric curves, much like we did with functions. Suppose that $f,g$ are differentiable functions and we need to find the tangent line at a point on the parametric curve $x = f(t)$ and $y = g(t)$, where y is also a differentiable function of $x$. If $dx/dt \ne 0$, then the slopes of the parametric curve is given by \begin{align*}
\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{dy/dt}{dx/dt}
\end{align*}


Furthermore suppose that $y$ is a twice differentiable function of $x$, then at any point $dx/dt \ne 0$ and \begin{align*}
\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} 
&= \frac{d}{dx} \left( \frac{dy}{dx} \right) = \frac{ \dfrac{d}{dt} \left( \dfrac{dy}{dx} \right) }{ \dfrac{dx}{dt} }
\end{align*}


Suppose that a curve C can be described by the parametric equations $x = f(t)$ and $y = g(t)$, where $\alpha \le t \le \beta$. Additionally, suppose that $f', g'$ are continuous in $\alpha \le t \le \beta$. Then the length of C is given by \begin{align*}
L = \int_{\alpha}^{\beta} \sqrt{ \left( \frac{dx}{dt} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{dy}{dt} \right)^2 } \, dt
\end{align*}

# Week 3
## Polar Coordinates

Week 3 tutorial notes [TBP](){download="week3"}

So far we have been working exclusively in the Cartesian/rectangular coordinate system. As we will see in the near future, this is not always the easiest coordinate system to work in. In this section, we will introduce the polar coordinate system. 

\begin{align*}
x &= r \cos{\theta}, \hspace{0.5cm} y = r \sin{\theta} \\
r^2 &= x^2 + y^2, \hspace{0.5cm} \tan{\theta} = \frac{y}{x}
\end{align*}

The second line of equation is used to help convert back and forth from the Cartesian coordinate system and the polar coordinate system. 

To find a tangent line to the polar curve $r = f{(\theta)}$, we regard $\theta$ as a parameter and write its parametric equations as 

\begin{align*}
x = r \cos{\theta} = f(\theta) \cos{\theta}, \hspace{0.5cm} y = r \sin{\theta}\sin{(\theta)} \\
\end{align*}

Then following the equation of slope for parametric curves and the product rule, 

$$\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{dy/d \theta}{dx/ d \theta} = \frac{\frac{dr}{d \theta} \sin{\theta} + r \cos{\theta}}{\frac{dr}{d \theta} \cos{\theta} - r \sin{\theta}}$$

We can locate horizontal tangents by finding points where $dy/d\theta = 0$ given that $dx/d\theta \ne 0$. Likewise, vertical tangents can be found where $dx/d\theta = 0$ given that $dy/d\theta \ne 0$.

## Equation of a Parabola, Ellipse, Hyperbola, and Sphere

Parabola:
\begin{align*}
x^2 = 4py, \hspace{0.5cm} \text{or} \hspace{0.5cm} y^2 = 4px  \\
\end{align*}

Ellipse:
\begin{align*}
\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} &= 1, \hspace{0.5cm} \text{where} \hspace{0.5cm} a \ge b > 0  \hspace{0.5cm} \text{or} \\
\frac{x^2}{b^2} + \frac{y^2}{a^2} &= 1, \hspace{0.5cm} \text{where} \hspace{0.5cm} a \ge b > 0 
\end{align*}

Hyperbola:
\begin{align*}
\frac{x^2}{a^2} - \frac{y^2}{b^2} &= 1, \hspace{0.5cm} \text{where} \hspace{0.5cm} a \ge b > 0  \hspace{0.5cm} \text{or} \\
\frac{y^2}{b^2} - \frac{x^2}{a^2} &= 1, \hspace{0.5cm} \text{where} \hspace{0.5cm} a \ge b > 0 
\end{align*}

Sphere:
\begin{align*}
(x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 + (z-l)^2 = r^2 \hspace{0.5cm} \text{where the center is located at $(h, k, l)$ with radius $r$}
\end{align*}


## Linear Algebra in 3D (Part I)

In 3D space, a point is represented as $(x, y, z)$.

An equation in terms of $x$ and $y$ defines a curve in the 2D space $\mathbb{R}^2$, while an equation in terms of $x, y$ and $z$ defines a surface in 3D space $\mathbb{R}^3$.

Given two points $P(x_1, y_1, z_1)$ and $Q(x_2, y_2, z_2)$, the distance between them is:
\begin{align*}
|PQ| = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2 + (z_2 - z_1)^2} \\
\end{align*}

A vector is a quantity with both magnitude and direction. Given two points $P$ and $Q$, the vector from $P$ to $Q$ is defined by the difference of their coordinates:
\begin{align*}
\bar{a} = \langle x_2 - x_1,\, y_2 - y_1,\, z_2 - z_1 \rangle
\end{align*}

To find the magnitude (or norm) of a vector $\vec{a} = (a_1, a_2, a_3) \in \mathbb{R}^3$, we compute:
$$|\vec{a}| = \sqrt{a_1^2 + a_2^2 + a_3^2}$$
The standard basis vectors in $\mathbb{R}^3$ is given by 
$$
\vec{i} = \langle 1, 0, 0 \rangle, \quad
\vec{j} = \langle 0, 1, 0 \rangle, \quad
\vec{k} = \langle 0, 0, 1 \rangle
$$

This is particularly useful as any vector in $\mathbb{R}^3$ can be written as:
$$\vec{a} = a_1\vec{i} + a_2\vec{j} + a_3\vec{k}$$

A unit vector is any vector with magnitute of $1$. The standard basis is an example of a unit vector. To convert any vector into a unit vector:
$$\vec{u} = \frac{\vec{a}}{|\vec{a}|} = \frac{\vec{a}}{\|\vec{a}\|} = \frac{\vec{a}}{\sqrt{a_1^2 + a_2^2 + a_3^2}}$$
