## Parametric Equations

Week 2 tutorial notes [TBP](){download="week2"}

Suppose there is a third variable $t$ (called a parameter), we can *parameterize* $x$ and $y$ by the equations 
\begin{align*}
x &= f(t) \\
y &= y(t)
\end{align*}
where $a \le t \le b$ which has initial point $(f(a), g(a))$ and terminal point $(f(b), g(b))$.

## First Derivative for Parametric Equations

Suppose that $f,g$ are differentiable functions and we need to find the tangent line at a point on the parametric curve $x = f(t)$ and $y = g(t)$, where y is also a differentiable function of $x$. If $dx/dt \ne 0$, then the slopes of the parametric curve is given by 
\begin{align*}
\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{dy/dt}{dx/dt}
\end{align*}

## Second Derivative for Parametric Equations

Furthermore suppose that $y$ is a twice differentiable function of $x$, then at any point $dx/dt \ne 0$ and \begin{align*}
\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} 
&= \frac{d}{dx} \left( \frac{dy}{dx} \right) = \frac{ \dfrac{d}{dt} \left( \dfrac{dy}{dx} \right) }{ \dfrac{dx}{dt} }
\end{align*}

## Arc Length for Parametric Equations

Suppose that a curve C can be described by the parametric equations $x = f(t)$ and $y = g(t)$, where $\alpha \le t \le \beta$. Furthermore, suppose that $f', g'$ are continuous in $\alpha \le t \le \beta$. Then the length of C is given by 
\begin{align*}
L = \int_{\alpha}^{\beta} \sqrt{ \left( \frac{dx}{dt} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{dy}{dt} \right)^2 } \, dt
\end{align*}
