## 1. Introduction

[Deletion after IMPutation (DIMP)](https://github.com/gmasuncion/dimp) is an R package that serves as a wrapper around the mice package. It performs multiple imputation on a dataset, then removes the imputed values for a specified outcome variable. This approach allows imputed covariates to be used in downstream analyses while avoiding analysis on imputed outcomes, which can introduce bias when the outcome is not missing at random.

## 2. Demonstration

Suppose we have the following original dataset which has missing values in columns X1 and X3.

| Y   | X1  | X2  | X3  |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| 1   | 2   | 5   | NA  |
| 0   | NA  | 4   | 2   |
| NA  | 4   | 2   | 4   |

After calling 'dimp()',

| Y   | X1  | X2  | X3  |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| 1   | 2   | 5   | 2   |
| 0   | 3   | 4   | 2   |
| NA  | 4   | 2   | 4   |

| Y   | X1  | X2  | X3  |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| 1   | 2   | 5   | 3   |
| 0   | 2   | 4   | 2   |
| NA  | 4   | 2   | 4   |

| Y   | X1  | X2  | X3  |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| 1   | 2   | 5   | 2   |
| 0   | 2   | 4   | 2   |
| NA  | 4   | 2   | 4   |

## 3. Installation and Example

To desmonstrate usage, we use the airquality dataset. We treat Ozone as the response variable.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(mice)
library(dimp)

exampledata <- airquality

original_missing <- colSums(is.na(exampledata))

mice_obj <- mice(exampledata, m = 5, maxit = 5, seed = 123)

# Check missing values after imputation (using completed dataset #1)
after_imputation <- colSums(is.na(complete(mice_obj, 1)))

mice_obj_deleted <- dimp(mice_obj, "Ozone")

# Check missing values after deletion of outcome
after_deletion <- colSums(is.na(complete(mice_obj_deleted, 1)))

missing_summary <- data.frame(
  Variable = names(original_missing),
  Original_NAs = original_missing,
  After_Imputation = after_imputation,
  After_dimp_Deletion = after_deletion
)
print(missing_summary)
```
