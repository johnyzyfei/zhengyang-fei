Hi, I'm <strong>John Fei</strong>,

<p>a <strong>Biostatistics MSc candidate</strong> at the University of Toronto with an emphasis in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science. I also have the privilege to work as a <strong>Student Researcher</strong> at the Institute for Better Health, Trillium Health Partners, under the supervision of Dr. Simona Minotti.</p>

<p>My research spans areas including <strong>patient experience and hospital quality improvement</strong>, where I analyze large-scale survey data to identify factors influencing care outcomes, as well as <strong>biomarker analysis for juvenile arthritis</strong>, where I support statistical modeling and clinical interpretation in collaboration with healthcare researchers.</p>

<p>I earned my <strong>HBSc in Statistics and Mathematics</strong> from Toronto in 2024, where my passion for health science, data science, and education blossomed while working with Dr. Asal Aslemand and others.</p>

<p>

Beyond academics, music has always been a source of joy for me. My favourite artsits include: John Mayer, Guns N' Roses, Linkin Park, and Jay Chou.
